Welcome to Yapeal (Yet Another PHP Eve Api Library)

If you're reading this on your server then you seem to have got Yapeal installed
on it and if you've used the installer everything should be configured already
for you as well. If you have installed it from a archive (tgz/zip) then you'll
need to look in config/ for an example file named yapeal-example.ini and make a
copy of it in the same directory named yapeal.ini and edit it to add your
information. You'll also need to find a way to add all the database tables
needed as well. You can try running install/createMySQLDatabase.php and
install/createMySQLTables.php from a command-line and they should make the same
database and tables that the installer would have done.

In the future I hope to have sections on installing, configuring, setup, and
troubleshooting but for now best I can do is refer you to the project Wiki at
http://code.google.com/p/yapeal/
There you should find information to help you out. Another resource is the forum
thread for Yapeal at Eve Online which you'll find at
http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=904182

Thanks for using Yapeal, Dragonaire
